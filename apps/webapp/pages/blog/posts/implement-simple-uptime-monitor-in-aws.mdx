You can use AWS EventBridge rules to schedule a Lambda function to run at a specific time or
on a set interval. Combining these two services unlocks a vast array of use cases and workloads.
Anything from regular web scraping jobs to automated daily reminders can be implemented
by scheduling Lambda functions with EventBridge rules.

In this article, we will be scheduling a Lambda function to run every 5 minutes to check
the health of a website. The Lambda function will send a simple HTTP request to the website server and
check the response code. If the response code is not 200, the Lambda function will send
an alert message to an SNS topic that can be subscribed to.

The only prerequisites for this article is having an AWS account and Node environment set up.

## Setting up AWS resources

This section will cover setting up the required AWS resources via the AWS console.

### Lambda Function

First, we need to create a Lambda function that will be used to check the health of our website.

Navigate to the AWS Lambda console and create a new Lambda function and give it a name.
After creating it, it should be visible in the console like this:

/>

Right now, the function only has template code that prints a hello-world message. Later in this article we will implement the
uptime checking logic in the Lambda function.

### EventBridge Rule

In order to schedule the Lambda function to run every 5 minutes, we need to create an EventBridge rule.
Navigate to the AWS EventBridge console and click the **Create Rule** button.

In the **Define rule detail** step, give the rule a name and set the **Rule type** to **Schedule** and proceed to the next step.

<BlogImg

  width="1920px"
  alt="AWS EventBridge console - Define rule detail"
  src="https://komonitor-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/create-uptime-monitor-aws/step-2.png"
/>

On the next step, define the schedule pattern and set the **Rate expression** to 5 minutes.

  width="1920px"
  alt="AWS EventBridge console - Define schedule pattern"
  src="https://komonitor-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/create-uptime-monitor-aws/step-3.png"
/>

Now, select the targets for this event rule. Select **AWS Service** and then **Lambda function**.
In the dropdown, the name Lambda function created earlier should be an option, select it.

  width="1920px"
  alt="AWS EventBridge console - Select targets"
  src="https://komonitor-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/create-uptime-monitor-aws/step-4.png"
/>

That is all the configuration needed to set up the event rule, proceed through the following steps and create the rule.

To confirm that the rule was created and configured to target the Lambda function, navigate to the Lambda console and take a look
at the function overview. The rule should be visible in the function overview and configuration tab like this:

  width="1920px"

  src="https://komonitor-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/create-uptime-monitor-aws/step-5.png"
/>

### SNS Topic and Lambda Permissions

Our uptime monitor will be capturing alerts via an SNS topic that over parties can subscribe to. Go to the SNS console and create a new FIFO topic.

<BlogImg

  width="1920px"
  alt="AWS SNS console with newly created FIFO topic"
  src="https://komonitor-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/create-uptime-monitor-aws/step-6.png"
/>

In order for the Lambda function to publish messages to the SNS topic, we need to edit the Lambda function's IAM role and give it permission to publish to the topic.
Go back to the Lambda console for the function, select the **Configuration** tab, then select **Permissions**. You will see the
Execution role listed. Click on it to be navigated to the IAM console.

Click on **Add permission** and then **Create inline policy**.

  height="919px"
  alt="IAM console for Lambda function execution role"
  src="https://komonitor-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/create-uptime-monitor-aws/step-7.png"
/>

In the inline policy visual editor, set the service to SNS and under actions, filter for and select **Publish**.

<BlogImg

  height="919px"
  alt="Inline policy visual editor"
  src="https://komonitor-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/create-uptime-monitor-aws/step-8.png"
/>

For **Resources**, enter the SNS topic ARN. Save the inline policy and make sure it is attached to the Lambda execution role.

## SQS queue and subscribing to SNS

We want to be able to see our alerts whenever our Lambda publishes a message to the SNS topic, so
we will create an SWS queue that will subscribe to messages from the SNS Topic and allow us to view messages in the AWS console.

Go to the SQS console and create a new FIFO queue like so:

<BlogImg
  height="1280px"
  width="1920px"
  alt="AWS SQS creation console"
  src="https://komonitor-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/create-uptime-monitor-aws/step-9.png"
/>

After creating the queue, you will see an overview of the queue.
Click on **Subscribe to Amazon SNS topic** and select the SNS topic you created earlier and create a subscription.

Now whenever we publish alert messages to the SNS topic, those messages will appear in the SQS queue.

All of the required AWS resources are now set up. In the next section, we will implement the Lambda function code.

## Lambda code

Now, let's write the code that will be executed by the Lambda function to perform uptime checking.
We will write the Lambda function in JavaScript and use the Node.js runtime with NPM.

Create a new directory on your system and run:

```bash
npm init
touch index.js
```

Then, install the **AWS SDK** and **fetch** packages:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk node-fetch
```

To use ESM modules, open `package.json` and add `"type": "module"`.

Open `index.js` and write the following code (Be sure to fill in your own website URL and SNS topic ARN.):

```javascript
import AWS from "aws-sdk";
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const snsClient = new AWS.SNS();
globalThis.fetch = fetch;

export async function handler(event) {
  try {
    const websiteUrl = "https://www.google.com";
    const uptimeCheckResponse = await fetch(websiteUrl, {
      method: "GET",
      redirect: "follow",
    });

    if (uptimeCheckResponse.status !== 200) {
      // publish to SNS
      const snsResult = await snsClient
        .publish(
          {
            TopicArn:
              "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:060780781184:Website-Alert-Topic.fifo",
            Message: `Received ${uptimeCheckResponse.status} status code from ${websiteUrl}`,
            MessageGroupId: "Website-Alert-Group",
            MessageDeduplicationId: new Date().getTime().toString(),
            Subject: "Website Down Alert",
          },
          async (err, data) => {
            if (err) {
              console.log(err);
              throw new Error(err);
            }
            console.log(data);
          }
        )
        .promise();
    } else {
      console.log("Website is up!");
    }

    const response = {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: "Lambda function executed successfully!",
    };
    return response;
  } catch (err) {
    // also publish to SNS in case of other errors
    const snsResult = await snsClient
      .publish(
        {
          TopicArn:
            "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:060780781184:Website-Alert-Topic.fifo",
          Message: "Error: " + err.message,
          MessageGroupId: "Website-Alert-Group",
          MessageDeduplicationId: new Date().getTime().toString(),
          Subject: "Website Down Alert",
        },
        async (err, data) => {
          if (err) {
            console.log(err);
          }
          console.log(data);
        }
      )
      .promise();
    const response = {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: "Lambda function execution failed!",
    };
    return response;
  }
}
```

Note that in this simple implementation, we hardcoded the website URL and SNS topic ARN.
Typically, we would want to read these values from the event that triggered the Lambda function or from environment variables.

To upload the code and dependencies to the Lambda function, we need to zip the files.
On Linux, this can be done using:

```bash
zip -r package.zip . *
```

This command will create a `package.zip` file in the current directory, and it will contain everything needed for Lambda.

On the Lambda function overview, go to the **Code** tab and upload the zip file containing the code.

## Making sure everything works

We can run the Lambda manually in the **Test** tab.
If the Lambda receives a 200 OK status code from the website it is monitoring, it will **not** publish a message to the SNS topic
and will instead log that the website is up like so:

<BlogImg
  height="1280px"
  width="1920px"
  alt="Lambda function execution output"
  src="https://komonitor-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/create-uptime-monitor-aws/step-10.png"
/>

If we want to see the alerts in action, change the website URL to **https://httpstat.us/400** so that we always get a 400 status code.
Reupload a new zip file to the Lambda function, then test again. The Lambda logs will indicate that the website is down that it published a message to the SNS topic.

To see the message, go to the SQS console for the queue and click on **Send and receive messages**. Click on **Poll for messages**, and you should be able to
see messages in the queue. Click on it to see the message details, which should look like this JSON object:

```json
{
  "Type": "Notification",
  "MessageId": "a44c27f8-9c68-507e-8ba9-7d3b45a76115",
  "SequenceNumber": "10000000000000011000",
  "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:060780781184:Website-Alert-Topic.fifo",
  "Subject": "Website Down Alert",
  "Message": "Received 400 status code from https://httpstat.us/400",
  "Timestamp": "2022-04-03T17:21:19.940Z",
  "UnsubscribeURL": "<URL>"
}
```

If you see a message like above in the queue, your uptime monitor is working! Try extending this simple
implementation to cover multiple URL's, regions, and more.

## Cleanup

To avoid getting random bills from AWS, we need to clean up the resources we created.

Make sure to delete the Lambda function, EventBridge rule, SNS topic, and SQS queue when they are no longer needed.
