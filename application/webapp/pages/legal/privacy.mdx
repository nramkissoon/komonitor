## Definitions

Komonitor is owned by Nicholas Ramkissoon, based in New York City. **(referred to as "I", "Me", "Our" or "We")**.
As a customer of this service you're a **"User" or "You"** according to this policy.
The applications or any services offered by us will be referred to as **"Komonitor", "App", "Website" or "Service"**.

## What user data does Komonitor collect?

### API-based data

When you add pages to test on the Komonitor application, Komonitor stores them on Komonitor servers.
The data is associated with your Komonitor account. When the data is stored in the Komonitor server,
Komonitor encrypts it in transit and at rest so that other people including the server administrators can not see the contents of the data.
The Komonitor servers use the data to provide monitoring and alerting services.

### Data about how you use Komonitor

When you use the Komonitor client apps, the Komonitor website, Komonitor logs data that might be identified to you:

- a random, unique identifier
- the version of the Komonitor app, and the operating system you are using
- network request data, such as the date and time, your IP address, and the URL
- number of monitors, results and the total data size of them

Komonitor uses this data to:

- keep our service working quickly and reliably
- debug and develop our apps and website
- defend Komonitor service from abuse and technical attacks
- improve search results on the website
- improve usability of our apps

Komonitor usually deletes log entries with identifiable information within a few weeks, but may preserve logs longer, as needed in specific cases,
such as investigations of specific incidents.

### Website usage data

When you visit [komonitor.com](/) and other Komonitor websites, Komonitor uses cookies, server logs, and other methods to collect data about
what pages you visit, and when. Komonitor also collects technical information about the software and computer you use, such as:

- your IP address
- your preferred language
- the web browser software you use
- the kind of computer you use
- the website that referred you

Komonitor uses data about how you use the website to:

- optimize the website, so that it's quick and easy to use
- diagnose and debug technical errors
- defend the website from abuse and technical attacks
- compile statistics on visitor searches and needs, to guide development of new website pages and functionality
- decide who to contact about about product announcements, service changes, and new features

Komonitor may preserve log entries for all kinds of visitors longer, as needed in specific cases,
such as for the investigation of specific incidents. Komonitor stores aggregate statistics indefinitely, but those statistics don't include data identifiable to you personally.

### Account data

Komonitor services require an Komonitor account. For example, you must have an Komonitor account to use the Komonitor web app.

To create an Komonitor account, Komonitor requires a working email address. Komonitor uses this data to provide you access to features and identify you across Komonitor service, publicly and within Komonitor.

You do not have to give your personal or legal name to create an Komonitor account. You can use a pseudonym instead. You can also open more than one account.

You don't have to give Komonitor a personal name or any social media names, and you can erase this data at any time.

Komonitor uses your email to:

- confirm if your email address is correct to sign you up
- notify you that your payment has failed
- notify you that your account's plan has been deactivated due to payment failure
- notify you about your annual subscription renewal 3 days before
- contact you in special circumstances related to your account
- contact you about support requests
- contact you about legal requests
- announce new Komonitor product offerings, service changes, and features

Komonitor stores account data as long as the account stays open.

### Payment card data

To continue using Komonitor service after exceeding free-tier limitations,
Komonitor requires your payment card data. Komonitor itself does not collect or store enough information to charge your card itself.
Rather, Stripe collects that data on Komonitor's behalf, and gives Komonitor security tokens that allow Komonitor to
create charges and subscriptions. Stripe meets the highest level of PCI compliance (Level 1). See more on their Security page.

Komonitor uses your payment card data only to charge for Komonitor service.

Komonitor instructs Stripe to store your payment card data only as long as you use paid Komonitor service.

### Correspondence with users

Komonitor collects data about you when you send Komonitor support requests, legal complaints, privacy inquiries, and business inquiries.
Those data usually include your name and email address, and may include your company or other affiliation.

Komonitor uses contact data to:

- respond to you
- compile aggregate statistics about correspondence
- train support staff and other Komonitor personnel
- review the performance of Komonitor personnel who respond
- defend Komonitor from legal claims

Komonitor stores correspondence as long as it may be useful for these purposes.

## Does Komonitor collect children's data?

Komonitor does not knowingly collect personal information or data from children or persons under the age of 18.
In the event that data of a person under the age of 18 is collected either through creating an account or using Komonitor services,
Komonitor will take immediate action to delete any data and accounts related to said person upon notification.

## Where is your data collected by Komonitor stored?

Data is kept on servers in the United States of America.

## How can you erase or change your data?

Closing your account starts a process of erasing Komonitor's records of your account data including Monitors and Alerts.

If you have questions or problems using the website to change or delete data about you, email support@komonitor.com.

## Does Komonitor share data about me with others?

Komonitor shares account data with others.
