including our various websites, APIs, email notifications, and applications **(the "Services" or "Komonitor")**,
and any information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services
**(collectively referred to as "Content")**. Komonitor is owned by Nicholas Ramkissoon.
**(referred to as "I", "Me", "Our" or "We")**. As a customer of this service you're a **"User" or "You"** according to this agreement.
Your access to and use of the Services are conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.

## Account Registrations and Passwords

1. You may be required to create an account with Komonitor in order to access certain Services.
   It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide on the Services is correct, current and complete.
   We reserve the right to disable any user account, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion,
   you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms.

2. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use in association with your account and for any activities or actions performed under your account.
   We recommend that you use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols)
   with your account and that you logout from your account at the end of every session. Komonitor cannot and will not be liable for any loss
   or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above. You agree to notify Komonitor immediately of any actual or suspected
   unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security known by you.

3. Your login may only be used by one person - a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted.
   You may create separate logins for as many people as you'd like.

4. You may not use the Service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).

## Privacy

1. Any information that you provide to Komonitor is subject to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy),
   which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services
   you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information
   to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Komonitor.

2. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages.
   These communications are considered part of the Services and your Komonitor account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.

## Payment and Refunds Terms

1. The Service is offered with an indefinite free trial. You will only be able to continue using the Service by paying in advance for additional usage.
   If you fail to pay for additional usage, your organization will be frozen and inaccessible until payment is made.

2. The credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle when your billing status changes.

3. If you switch a plan to another one with different billing cycle (e.g., from a monthly plan to a yearly plan),
   the billing date becomes the date of the switch. By default, Komonitor prorates subscription costs in this case.

4. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service.

5. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities.

## API Terms

Users may access their Service data via the Application Program Interface **("API")**.
Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses the Service,
is bound by the terms of this agreement plus the following specific terms:

1. You expressly understand and agree that we shall not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.

2. Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Service via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API.
   We, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.

## Cancellation and Termination

   An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation.
   You can cancel your account at any time by visiting your Account settings in the web application.

2. All of your data will be immediately be inaccessible and deleted from the Service upon cancellation.
   This information can not be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.

4. We, in our sole discretion, have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service for any reason at any time.
   Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment
   of all content in your account. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

5. We will terminate your account if it becomes inactive (9 months without logging in or subscription payment).
   We will attempt to notify you several times before this occurs.
