Team permissions allow teams to control what team members are allowed to do within Komonitor.
There are three permission level roles available within a team: **admin**, **edit**, **view**.

## View permission

The view permission is the most restrictive permission. Team members with this permission are only able to
view monitors, projects, and settings. Attempting to edit anything within the team will result in an error.

## Edit permission

Team members with the edit permission are granted the same privileges allowed with the view permission in addition to the ability to
edit monitors, projects, and settings within the team. This permission also allows team members to delete monitors/projects and invite and remove team members.

## Admin permission

The admin role is a special team role. Only the team creator is allowed to be admin. The admin permission
grants access to all resources within the team, and allows the admin to manage Stripe billing and delete the team permanently.

The admin permission role is assigned to the user that originally creates the team.

There is only **one** admin user per team and that user cannot leave the team without fully deleting it.
