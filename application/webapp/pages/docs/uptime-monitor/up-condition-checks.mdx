Up Condition Checks are run on every uptime check to determine whether or not to consider a website or API "up." They are powerful, user-defined assertions
that check various parts of a website's or API's response. Currently, you
can define up condition checks to check for specific **HTTP status codes**,
**request latencies**, **JSON response bodies**, and **HTML response bodies**.
