title: Up Condition Checks
description: Uptime monitors regularly check URL's and determines if websites are down. This page covers what properties define an uptime monitor and it's behavior.

Up Condition Checks are run on every uptime check to determine whether or not to consider a website or API "up." They are powerful, user-defined assertions
that check various parts of a website's or API's response. Currently, you
can define up condition checks to check for specific **HTTP status codes**,
**request latencies**, **JSON response bodies**, and **HTML response bodies**.

You can define up to **10** up condition checks per uptime monitor. If any check fails, the check is considered "down".

## Default Behavior

If no up conditions are specified by the user, Komonitor's uptime monitoring logic will default to checking if a
website or API returns a **200 OK** status code to determine uptime. This default behavior is sufficient for ensuring simple web pages are
up.

## HTTP Status Code Checks

HTTP status code checks verify a specific HTTP status code or range of status codes is returned before determining if a website is up.

Each status code check requires 2 fields:

- **Code** - the expected code to be compared against
- **Comparison** - a numerical comparison operator (equal, not equals, greater, less, etc.)

## HTML Response Checks

For websites that return HTML, HTML checks can be used to verify specific content is being returned to the user.

Each HTML response check requires 2 fields:

- **Value** - the expected content to be compared against
- **Comparison** - either "contains" or "not contains" that will check whether the returned HTML contains or does not contain the expected value, respectively.

## Latency Checks

Latency checks can be run on the different **timing phases** of the request sent to websites. These checks can be used to get a better understanding of what kind of
latencies your users are experiencing and alert when latency times are too long.

Latency checks requires 3 fields:

- **Value** - the expected value to be compared against in **milliseconds**
- **Comparison** - a numerical comparison operator (equal, not equals, greater, less, etc.)
- **Timing Phase** - the timing phase of the request, more on this below

### Request Timing Phases

Komonitor uses the [Got library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got) to send HTTP request to your websites and APIs during an uptime check. The library allows us to
measure and record timing phases of each request that you can then use in your uptime monitors and alerting logic.

Request timing phases are defined here: [https://github.com/szmarczak/http-timer#api](https://github.com/szmarczak/http-timer#api)

## JSON Response Checks

JSON response checks verify specific fields in a JSON response are correct. This check is useful for verifying API's are sending correct information.

JSON checks consists of 3 fields:

- **Value** - required based on the selected comparison, the expected value to be compared against
- **Comparison** - a JSON value comparison operator, includes numerical operators as well as JSON specific operators such as "is null" and "contains"
- **JSONPath** - the JSONPath used to find the key in the JSON response you want to check, more on JSONPath below

### JSONPath

JSONPath is a declarative syntax used to query for keys in a JSON object.

You can learn the syntax here: [https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html#e2](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html#e2)

There is an online evaluator for testing JSONPath expressions against JSON here: [https://jsonpath.com/](https://jsonpath.com/)
