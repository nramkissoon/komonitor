description: Uptime monitors regularly check URL's and determines if websites are down.

Komonitor's uptime monitors are a piece of software that regularly checks a given website and
determines whether or not that website is down. Specifically, uptime monitors send
HTTP requests to a website URL and records the response. Currently, Komonitor uptime monitors
consider a website to be **down** if the monitor **does not receive a 200 OK response status code from the assigned website**.

Uptime monitors record website HTTP responses in the form of **uptime monitor statuses** and
can trigger **alerts** if configured by the user.

## Uptime Monitor Properties

All uptime monitors share a set of properties that you can edit. As a user, when creating
or editing an uptime monitor, you define these properties to adjust the monitor's behavior to fit your needs.

### General Properties

- `Monitor Name` - the name of the monitor as it will appear in the app dashboard
- `URL` - the URL of the website to be monitored
- `Region` - the location from which the uptime monitor will check the website
- `Check Frequency` - the time interval between monitor checks--if set to 30 minutes, the monitor will run every 30 minutes

### Alert Properties

- `Failures Before Alert` - the number of failures that are tolerated before an alert is triggered
- `Alert Description` - description text that will show up in alerts

### Advanced Settings

- `Webhook URL` - a URL the monitor should push uptime statuses to, this feature is available for paid-plan users
- `HTTP Headers` - custom HTTP headers that should be sent as a part of the HTTP request uptime check

### Uptime Monitor Status Properties

Uptime monitor status are a record of a _specific_ uptime check at a particular point in time.

- `monitor_id` - the ID of the monitor that created the status
- `timestamp` - the timestamp of the status in milliseconds

- `latency` - the latency of the HTTP response in milliseconds
