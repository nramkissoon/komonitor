title: What is an Uptime Monitor?
description: Uptime monitors regularly check URL's and determines if websites are down.
---

Komonitor's uptime monitors are a piece of software that regularly checks a given website and
determines whether or not that website is down. Specifically, uptime monitors send
HTTP requests to a website URL and records the response. Currently, Komonitor uptime monitors
consider a website to be **down** if the monitor **does not receive a 200 OK response status code from the assigned website**.

Uptime monitors record website HTTP responses in the form of **uptime monitor statuses** and
can trigger **alerts** if configured by the user.

## Uptime Monitor Properties

All uptime monitors share a set of properties that you can edit. As a user, when creating
or editing an uptime monitor, you define these properties to adjust the monitor's behavior to fit your needs.

### General Properties

- `Monitor Name` - the name of the monitor as it will appear in the app dashboard
- `URL` - the URL of the website to be monitored
- `Region` - the location from which the uptime monitor will check the website
- `Check Frequency` - the time interval between monitor checks--if set to 30 minutes, the monitor will run every 30 minutes

### Alert Properties

- `Failures Before Alert` - the number of failures that are tolerated before an alert is triggered
- `Alert Description` - description text that will show up in alerts
- `Channels` - methods the alert will be delivered (e.g. email, Slack)
- `Recipients` - lists of who will receive alerts through the defined alert channels

### HTTP Settings

- `Method` - the HTTP method used to send an uptime check to the website
- `HTTP Headers` - custom HTTP headers that should be sent as a part of the HTTP request uptime check
- `Body` - the request body sent during the uptime check
- `Follow Redirects` - indicates whether or not to follow redirects during HTTP request

### Uptime Monitor Status Properties

Uptime monitor status are a record of a _specific_ uptime check at a particular point in time.

- `monitor_id` - the ID of the monitor that created the status
- `timestamp` - the timestamp of the status in milliseconds
- `status` - the status of the website--either 'down' or 'up'
- `request` - the request object containing request options and other data used during the uptime check
- `response` - the response object returned from the website, contains data such as response times
- `monitor_snapshot` - a copy of the uptime monitor during the time of uptime check corresponding to this status
