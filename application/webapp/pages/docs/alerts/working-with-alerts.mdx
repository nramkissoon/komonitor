This is a quick reference guide for working with alerts.

## Creating, Updating, and Deleting Alerts

### Creating an alert

You can create an alert by going to the [alert creation form page](/app/alerts/new) and filling the form out.

### Updating an alert

For editing an already existing alert, navigate to the [alert overview page](/app/alerts) and press the edit button
on the alert you wish to update. You can also edit the alert from that alert's details page.

### Deleting an alert

To delete an alert, navigate to the [alert overview page](/app/alerts) and press the delete button
on the alert you wish to update. You can also delete the alert from that alert's details page. A confirmation alert
will appear to ensure you want to delete the alert.

### Disabling an alert

Disabling and enabled an alert can be done via the alert update process described earlier.

## Viewing Alerts Details

To view a specific alert in detail, navigate to the [alert overview page](/app/alerts) and press the details button
on the alert you wish to view. The details page contains information on:

- alert state, severity, description, last invocation, and recipients
- monitors the alert is attached to (you can detach the alert from this page)

### Alert invocations

Invocations for a specific alert are listed in a table on the alert details page.
The table includes:

- timestamp of the alert
- the monitor that triggered the alert
- the severity of the alert
- the recipients that received the alert
