Komonitor alerts you when you monitors detect trouble on your websites. Just like uptime monitors, alerts
are highly customizable so that you can adapt them to you use case.

## Alert Properties

All alerts share a set of properties that define their behavior. As a user, when creating or editing an alert, you
define these properties to fit your needs.

- `Alert Name` - the name of the alert as it will appear in the app dashboard
- `Alert Type` - the channel through which the alert will send messages (e.g. Email, Slack, etc)
- `Severity` - a user defined severity for the alert to help with incident response
- `Description` - a user defined description to assist with incident response
- `Recipients` - to whom the alert will be sent to, depends on Alert Type (e.g. email addresses, slack channels)
- `State` - either `Disabled` or `Enabled`, used to stop alerts from being sent out if required

## Alert Invocation Properties

An **alert invocation** is a record of an alert that was sent to the user. Alert invocations store data about the alert and monitor that triggered the alert.
This information is useful for diagnosing problems and incident analysis, and invocations can be viewed in the web app.

Alert invocation properties include, but is not limited to:

- `alert` - the alert associated with the invocation
- `monitor` - the monitor that triggered the alert
- `statuses` - the monitor statuses (typically down statuses) that are involved in triggering the alert
- `timestamp` - when the alert was triggered
