title: Uptime Monitor Status Webhooks
description: Komonitor allow users to receive uptime monitor status updates via a webhook endpoint on their own applications and services.
---

You can receive update monitor statuses via webhook requests sent to your service or application webhook endpoint. Uptime monitor statuses contain
information on the response received by the uptime monitor from the configured URL, the request parameters sent to the URL, the monitor configuration, and more.
See the section below that dives into each of the fields included in an uptime monitor status for more information.

To receive uptime monitor statuses via webhooks, you have to tell Komonitor the URL where the webhook request should be sent. You can enter this URL in the uptime monitor
creation or edit form. Every subsequent monitor status generated by uptime checks will then be sent to the specified URL.

## Uptime Monitor Status Webhook Payload

The payload sent with each uptime monitor status webhook request will have the following structure and data types.

**Note:** Komonitor uses [Got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) for HTTP requests.
Request and response objects in the payload correspond to Got request options and response types, but key names are in snake case for consistency.

```typescript
interface Payload {
  type: "uptime-monitor-status"; // identifies the type of payload data
  data: {
    monitor_id: string; // ID of monitor
    timestamp: number; // when the uptime check occurred in milliseconds
    status: "up" | "down"; // status determined from monitor's configured condition checks
    request: {
        // see https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/blob/main/source/core/options.ts
