title: Getting Started With Webhooks
description: Komonitor webhooks allow users to receive alerts and monitor status updates via a webhook endpoint.
---

Webhooks allow your services to receive requests about specific Komonitor resources such as uptime monitor statuses and alerts.

## Headers

All webhooks contain the following set of request headers:

```json
{
  "content-type": "application/json",
  "request-id": "<request_uuid>",
  "komonitor-hook-type": "<resource>",
  "komonitor-hook-timestamp": "<timestamp>",
  "komonitor-hook-signature": "<generated_signature>"
}
```

### komonitor-hook-type

This is the type of resource that triggered the webhook request.

**Possible values**

- alert
- uptime-monitor-status

### komonitor-hook-signature

A hash generated using your webhook secret and the request itself -- used to verify the authenticity of the request.

## Request JSON Structure

All webhooks share the following common elements.

- **type** - same as `Komonitor-Hook-Type` header, indicates the type of resource that triggered the request and what data the payload contains

- **data** - an object containing information about the resource, content differs based on **type**, documentation for each data type is listed below

Documentation for specific data types and how to set up webhook requests for each:

- [Uptime Monitor Status Webhooks](/docs/webhooks/uptime-monitor-status)
- [Alert Webhooks](/docs/webhooks/alerts)

## Webhook Secrets

To verify requests hitting you service's webhook endpoint are coming from Komonitor, you will need a **webhook secret** to verify the signature sent in each request.

### Creating a webhook secret

Creating a webhook secret for you personal account can be done on the Settings page [here](/app/settings).
Personal accounts are limited to **1** secret per account. If you need to create a new secret, you have to delete the old one and
update your applications accordingly.

Treat webhook secrets as you would any other secret or API key. Do not expose them and follow security best practices.

### Using the secret to verify a webhook request

Below is a JavaScript code snippet showing how to verify the webhook request signature is from Komonitor.

```typescript
const crypto = require("crypto");

function verifySignature(request, secret = "") {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret);
  hmac.update(JSON.stringify(request.body), "utf8");
  const digest = hmac.digest("hex");
  return digest === request.headers["komonitor-hook-signature"];
}
```
