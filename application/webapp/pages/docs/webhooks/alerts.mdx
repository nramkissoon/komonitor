title: Alert Webhooks
description: Komonitor allow users to receive alerts via a webhook endpoint on their own applications and services.
---

You can receive alerts via webhook requests sent to your service or application webhook endpoint.
Alert webhooks are a powerful tool that allow your applications to respond quickly when your websites or APIs go down.
Alerts contain information on the monitor that triggered it, as well as references to the down monitor statuses that
contributed to it.

To receive webhook alerts for your uptime monitors, you have to tell Komonitor the URL where the webhook request should be sent. You can enter this URL in the uptime monitor
creation or edit form. Every subsequent alert generated by monitor will then be sent to the specified URL.

## Alert Webhook Payload

The payload sent with every alert webhook request will have the following structure and data types.

```typescript
interface Payload {
  type: "alert"; // identifies the type of payload data
  data: {
    monitor_id: string; // identifies monitor associated with the alert
    alert: {
      description: string;
      recipients: {
        // list of email addresses, slack channels, etc. where alert was sent
        Slack?: string[];
        Email?: string[];
        Webhook?: string[];
      };
      channels: string[]; // channels the alert was sent too
    };
    timestamp: number;
    monitor: object; // state of the monitor at the time of the alert
    statuses: {
      // list of monitor statuses that triggered the alert
      id: string;
      timestamp: number;
    }[];
    ongoing: boolean; // indicates if the alert is still ongoing (no "up" statuses since last invocation)
  };
}
```
