description: Komonitor quick-start guide for creating an uptime monitor and email alert for new users.
---

This quick-start guide will teach you how to set up a basic uptime monitor and
attach an email alert that triggers after one failure. The alert will trigger if the
uptime monitor detects your site has been down for one uptime check.

The only prerequisite for this guide is having and being logged in to a Komonitor account.

## Creating an Uptime Monitor

Creating an uptime monitor is simple and can be done in a matter of minutes.

First, navigate to the [uptime monitor creation form](/app/uptime/new).
Next, fill in some values for the `Monitor Name`, `URL`, `Region`, and `Check Frequency` fields.

Here is a sample form that will create a monitor that will check whether or not [google.com](https://google.com) is up:

<docImg
  src={"/docs/quick-start/qs1.jpg"}
  width="1214px"
  height="1080px"
  alt="Uptime monitor creation form"
/>

This example has set the `Check Frequency` to every 30 minutes, meaning that the uptime monitor will send a request to google.com every 30 minutes.

Notice the Alert Settings are unchanged for now because we have not created an alert yet. We'll get back to this setting later.

For now, hit the create button and you will be redirected to an overview page where you can view your monitors. Easy!

Next we'll will create an alert.

## Creating an Alert

Creating an alert is just as simple as a monitor.

Navigate to the [alert creation form](/app/alerts/new), then, fill in some values for the `Alert Name`, `Alert Type`, `Severity`, `Description`, and `Recipients` fields.

Here is a sample form filled out with these values:

<docImg
  src={"/docs/quick-start/qs2.jpg"}
  width="1080px"
  height="960px"
  alt="Alert creation form"
/>

Hit the create button and you will be redirected to an overview page where you can view you alerts. Simple!

## Attaching an Alert to a Monitor

Currently, we have created an uptime monitor and an alert, but they do not know about each other yet. In order to allow the uptime monitor to trigger the alert
whenever the monitored website is down, the alert must be _attached_ to the monitor.

As mentioned earlier, we can attach the alert to the monitor by editing the monitor.

Go to the [monitor overview page](/app/uptime) and click the edit button for your monitor. You will be directed to an edit form similar to the creation form.
In the alert settings, the name of alert you created will appear as an option under the `Alert` field. You edit form should look something like this:

<docImg
  src={"/docs/quick-start/qs3.jpg"}
  width="1200px"
  height="1068px"
  alt="Monitor edit form"
/>

Hit the update button and that's it! You have now created a monitor and an alert, and you have attached the alert to the monitor in order to trigger alert whenever
the monitor detects a website is down.
