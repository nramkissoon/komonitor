description: Komonitor quick-start guide for creating an uptime monitor and email alert for new users.
---

This quick-start guide will teach you how to set up a basic uptime monitor and
attach an email alert that triggers after one failure. The alert will trigger if the
uptime monitor detects your site has been down for one uptime check.

The only prerequisite for this guide is having and being logged in to a Komonitor account.

## Creating a Project

Projects allow you to group monitors and alerts logically and keeps everything organized. Monitors can only be created within a project, so if you have not
created a project do so now. You'll be prompted to create a new project on the app home screen.

After entering a name for the new project and creating it, you'll be directed to the project's overview page. Here, we will create an uptime monitor.

## Creating an Uptime Monitor

Creating an uptime monitor is simple and can be done in a matter of minutes.

First, navigate to the uptime monitor creation form in your project. You can get there by going to the **Uptime Monitor** tab and clicking the create button.
Next, fill in some values for the `Monitor Name`, `URL`, `Region`, and `Check Frequency` fields.

Here is a sample form that will create a monitor that will check whether or not Google is up:

<docImg
  src={"/docs/quick-start/qs1.png"}
  width="1090px"
  height="968px"
  alt="Uptime monitor creation form"
/>

This example has set the `Check Frequency` to every 30 minutes, meaning that the uptime monitor will send a request to google.com every 30 minutes.

### Creating an Alert

Creating an alert is just as simple as the monitor. The alert settings are right below the monitor settings we configured earlier.
Toggle the "Add an alert?" switch to access the alert settings.

Here is the sample form filled out for an email alert:

<docImg
  src={"/docs/quick-start/qs2.png"}
  width="1088px"
  height="968px"
  alt="Alert creation form"
/>

Hit the create button and you will be redirected to an overview page where you can view the monitor you just created. Simple!
