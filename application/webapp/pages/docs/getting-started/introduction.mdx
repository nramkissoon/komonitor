Komonitor is a **website monitoring and alerting service**. You can use the service to create and manage monitors and alerts for your websites.
Komonitor can regularly monitor your websites for:

A core component of the service is **alerting**. You can define alerts ant its delivery method and attach them to your monitors. Komonitor will alert you when your
monitor detects a failure.
