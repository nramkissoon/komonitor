**Uptime monitoring shouldn't be locked behind paid subscriptions.** Several website monitoring services exist, however, almost all of them
lock most of their advanced features behind a paid subscription. On top of that, if they offer a free plan, they severely limit the total monitors and alerting channels you are allowed
to have in order to encourage you to transfer to a paid plan. Of course, you can build your own monitoring system, but most do not have the resources to do so.

## Everyone Needs Uptime Monitoring in One Form or Another

Everyone has a website these days. Most of these websites don't generate revenue to cover the costs of a uptime monitoring service. People have personal websites,
portfolios, hobby projects, and apps that still require maintenance and uptime monitoring.
The last thing you want is for an interested hiring manager to go to your website only to be met with a 5xx error code. Even worse, users experiencing an
outage you are not aware of will drive them away from your projects and destroy trust.

Building websites, applications, and APIs is only one part
of the software cycle. There is still work to do to ensure what you build stays online for your users. Many do not have the time
or interest to invest in learning and building DevOps or SRE systems for simpler websites, this is where Komonitor's free plan comes in.

## Free Uptime Monitoring

At Komonitor, we offer a free plan for anyone that needs website and API uptime monitoring. This plan is free **forever**, and does not require
users to submit any payment information. With up to **80 uptime monitors** and alerting included, users setup uptime monitors for several websites and APIs and
receive alerts whenever their monitors detect a problem. Setting up a monitoring alerting system should be a "set it and forget it" kind of experience. You can
confidently create your uptime monitors and alerting channels and not have worry about if they are working. Komonitor provides this seamless experience out of the box.
Once an uptime monitor and alert is created, users can safely forget about them until an alert goes off. No extra maintenance required from the user.

On top of great user experience, Komonitor's uptime monitors give users massive control over the monitors' behavior and alerting.
The following uptime monitoring features are offered to all users, including those on the free plan:

- email and slack alerting
- uptime checks from 16 different regions around the world
- custom HTTP headers, body, and method with every uptime check
- checking uptime based on status code, response timings, or JSON/HTML response body content
- monitor history and data available on request

Other services such as UptimeRobot do not offer the same level of configuration in their own free subscription plans, or not even in their expensive subscription plans.

In short, whether you have a personal website or blog, run a web application, or need to monitor APIs you consume but do not have the budget for
paid uptime monitoring solution, Komonitor's free uptime monitoring plan will have you covered with its configurable monitors and robust alerting.
The only thing needed to get started is an account, [sign up now](/auth/signin).
