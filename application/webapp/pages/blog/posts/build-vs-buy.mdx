title: Build vs. Buy - Monitoring Infrastructure
description: The current explosion of developer and SaaS tooling has created a debate centered around building vs. buying software solutions for your product. Komonitor, as a website monitoring and alerting software service, can be implemented by any developer, but is it worth it?

When building a modern software product, several features and functionalities must be included depending on the product.
If the product needs to take customer payments, a payments processor service is needed. Likewise, if a
product requires monitoring and alerting systems to know when the service is down, then engineers building the product need to implement a service that does that.

Now, in the world of modern SaaS offerings, **developers do not need to build every component of their product from scratch**. They can simply pay a software service provider that fits their
use case. In the case of payments processing, this has become the norm for new and small companies. Implementing and maintaining a payments processing service requires
expertise, time, and massive risk tolerance. Luckily, we have services like Stripe and Paddle that handle most, if not all, of the risk and expert domain knowledge required to
process online payments. The smart move with regards to payments is to buy.

What about monitoring and alerting infrastructure? The risks aren't as severe as handling your customers credit card info, so the case for buying is not as strong. However,
let's explore the costs and benefits in more detail.

## Why Build?

A website monitoring and alerting service is not _that_ challenging to build on paper. Put together a Lambda function that checks your website, a UI, and a email service and
you've got the most basic implementation of one.

By building your own solution, you have full control of what dependencies you have, what features are implemented,
where your data is stored and accessed, etc. You do not have to go to a 3rd party for feature requests and bug fixes. If you already have a skilled engineer ot engineering team, the
initial costs to build the solution are probably not as prohibitive and building may be a worthwhile investment. Building a solution in an unfamiliar domain can generate expertise
in that problem domain and create new business opportunities.

Also, if you trust yourself or your engineers to build a superior product that best fits your needs, go for it!

## Why Buy?

Unless you are a large company or require a very specific set of features that are not offered on the market, building monitoring and alerting infrastructure is
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. If you are a founder or a small startup, **you should be focusing on building your product and marketing**, not worrying
about something as mundane as monitoring infrastructure (although, Komonitor is built on fairly complex, global cloud infra). Also, forget it if you're not even a software company. Building out an entire engineering team is not worth it.

Let's run some numbers to see the costs of building a similar solution versus buying. Assume the hourly rate of an engineer is around $60/hour. A product like Komonitor
takes about 2 weeks to build out for an experienced engineer. $60 \* 80 hours = **$4,800**! The only entities that have that kind of money and manpower are large businesses.
On top of the initial development costs, you now have to maintain the infra you've built, further increasing costs in the long run. Now, suppose there was a service out there that
covered your use case and eliminated all the maintenance hassle for $30/month. To break even with building, you will need to be paying the service provider for 160 months, or <b>over 13 years</b>!
There is a reason there has been an explosion of SaaS products, and this pricing structure is a main driving force.
You'll have to be the judge of whether or not you'll even need to pay for 13 years.

Monetary costs aside, there are more benefits to buying a solution. A trusted service provider would be an expert in their product domain whereas you or you're team might not be and would need
to spend time researching the domain. Ideally, the service provider is focused on providing the best solution for you while you and your team focus on building you revenue-generation products.
Essentially, you can maintain development velocity while adding the benefits of the software you are buying.

## Conclusion

So, should you build or buy monitoring and alerting software? It depends on your specific needs, and only you can decide on what's the better decision. That said, if you are a founder or part of a small
organization, you're resources and time is already stretched thin. Adding a the development of a separate product to your workload is not optimal or wise. There are prebuilt solutions out there that others
like yourself use and enjoy.
