**Komonitor has officially launched, and is now available for everyone!** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Launch

Komonitor has been in development for roughly 4 months. In those 4 months, I've built a modern website uptime checker with an
intuitive and easy-to-use UI along with an email alerting system that triggers according to user requirements. Powering these services is an intense
AWS backend--scheduled Lambda functions firing off every minute every minute in 15 regions around the world.

Komonitor is new entrant in the already crowded market of website monitoring tools. Big names in the market include UptimeRobot and Pingdom. These services
are geared towards more technical website maintainers and admins that have deeper technical knowledge. However, nowadays, anyone can build and deploy a website or service
with little coding or technical experience. The new generation of website owners still need monitoring and alerting tools to ensure they are providing the best quality experience to
their users.

Komonitor aims to be _the_ tool for this generation by abstracting away the complexities of monitoring and alerting infrastructure and giving users a seamless UI to create monitors
and alerts.

**At launch the following features are available:**

- uptime monitors that can be deployed to major region around the world
- customizable email alerts
- dashboards for managing and viewing your monitors and alerts

With these features, users are able to monitor their websites easily and receive alerts the moment something is amiss.

## What's Next?

Currently, Komonitor is very much an MVP. There are an endless number of improvements to be made and features to be implemented.

**Here's what's in development right now:**

- Slack integration and Slack alerts
- UI improvements across the entire app
- fine-grain control over HTTP requests sent during an uptime check
- scheduled Google Lighthouse jobs with alerting based on Lighthouse reports
- annual pricing plans and associated discounts for paid plans

These are just user-facing features you should expect to see in the near future. On top of that, we are striving to make Komonitor as resilient and scalable as possible via non-user facing improvements.

Expect to see more blog posts. Komonitor should not only provide you the monitoring tools, but also the knowledge and best-practices for implementing effective monitoring and alerting solutions.

### Building in Public

Komonitor is an indie product--it is 100% independent and bootstrapped. I have little money for marketing, and I also want to be as transparent as possible with users.
Since development began, I built Komonitor in secret--that does not help get the product in front of users at all.

So, from now on, development updates, announcements, etc. will be
sent out via Twitter [@komonitor](https://twitter.com/komonitor) and through this blog if applicable. Hopefully, this allows me to communicate with users and better address their needs.

I look forward to continuing work on Komonitor!
