title: Implement an Uptime Monitor Using AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and SNS.
description: >
  This article will walk you through the steps to implement a website uptime monitor
  using AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and SNS.

You can use AWS EventBridge rules to schedule a Lambda function to run at a specific time or
on a set interval. Combining these two services unlocks a vast array of use cases and workloads.
Anything from regular web scraping jobs to automated daily reminders can be implemented
by scheduling Lambda functions with EventBridge rules.

In this article, we will be scheduling a Lambda function to run every 5 minutes to check
the health of a website. The Lambda function will send a simple HTTP request to the website server and
check the response code. If the response code is not 200, the Lambda function will send
an alert message to an SNS topic for further distribution.
